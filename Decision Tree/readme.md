Disadvantages of D3 algorithm:      
      
1. ID3 algorithm, the information gain is used as the evaluation criterion when selecting the branch attributes in the root and internal nodes. The disadvantage of information gain is that the tendency to select values is more attributes, and in some cases such attributes may not provide much valuable information.
2. ID3 algorithm can only construct a decision tree for data sets whose attributes are discrete attributes.
