Machine Learning Tips:

1. Generalized algorithm
Learn how to apply algorithms and avoid overfitting problems

2. Training set always before the Test set     
Training set: A set of examples used for learning, which is to fit the parameters [i.e., weights] of the classifier. 
Validation set: A set of examples used to tune the parameters [i.e., architecture, not weights] of a classifier, for example to choose the number of hidden units in a neural network. 
Test set: A set of examples used only to assess the performance [generalization] of a fully specified classifier.
